## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project solidified my knowledge in css positioning so as to improve the look and feel of a webpage.
Can you imagine that when the web browser is in device emulation mode, hover states unlike focus and active don't work. I continued thinking there was something missing in my code until I removed the web browser from device emulation mode.
It is so much fun! I look forward to learning more about frontend web development.

### Continued development

I look forward to learning much more about css animations and the event-driven Javascript.

### Useful resources

The internet as well as good prompt engineering with AI helped me dymystify some parts of the projects.
